  <b>WBMA</b> The 10th Brazilian Workshop on Agile Methods (WBMA’2019) is the research track in the Agile Brazil conference. WBMA is an academic event that focuses on agile software development. This year’s edition comes with a history of success. Our past editions received an expressive number of paper submissions. Besides it, a number of attendees (students, researchers and practitioners) from different countries. We hope to repeat this success this year and influence even more the academic integration in industry context. We believe this integration can create ideas, opportunities and innovations for all involved.

  Last year, the Agile Brazil conference has received more than XXX attendees from all over the world.

This year, WBMA’2019 will be held on October, XXX - XXX, in Belo Horizonte/MG - Brazil. The workshop will be included in Agile Brazil schedule.

<h3>Keynote</h3>
<p><b>Kate Stewart,  Senior Director of Strategic Programs,  The Linux Foundation</b></p>
<p><i> Lessons learned from the Linux Kernel: creating sustained healthy communities </i></p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>
  The Linux Kernel is one of the most successful open source projects to date.  After 26 years, the rate of code contribution continues to be high,  new developers are still being attracted to participating, and the code is in widespread use.   By analyzing the contributions, we can see how individuals impact the kernel’s evolution as a whole,  as do the organizations in the kernel ecosystem.  So what lessons can we learn from this information?   What information is relevant to software community health in general that is not being caught in traditional health metrics?  This talk will discuss how the insights from the Linux kernel are being applied to other Linux Foundation open source projects to create healthy vibrant communities producing useful code for us all.
